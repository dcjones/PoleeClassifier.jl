Experiments building RNA-Seq (and perhaps other omics data) classifiers using
[polee](https://github.com/dcjones/polee) approximate likelihood.

Can we build very efficient uncertainty aware classifiers for cell/type
type/state using deep learning and the Polya tree transformation? I don't know!
Tune in to find out!

Lmk if this sounds cool and you want to colab, especially if you have some nice
data.
